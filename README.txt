// Welcome to the Python Shed
-----------------------------

I wanted a place to share random python utilities and code. Stuff that isn't significant enough to get its own repo. This is that place.
(the name python-shed is a pun, get it?)

INDEX:

cycles.py - It measures (in a completely useless way) the relative speed of how quickly the python interpreter can run through some recursive code.

comarg.py - [!! DEPRECATED: replaced by argparse in the standard Python library] A simple support library for dealing with sys.argv in a more user-friendly way. It's even multiplatform... probably... if I did the Windows bit right...
